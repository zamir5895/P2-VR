    /// Abstract base class for "decorator" types use in Context-based decoration. While you can inherit from this directly
    /// to create new "decorator" types, in most cases you probably want to inherit instead from
    /// <see cref="ValueToClassDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>, <see cref="ClassToClassDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>,
    /// or <see cref="ClassToValueDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>.
    /// </summary>
    /// <typeparam name="InstanceT">The type of what is being decorated</typeparam>
    /// <typeparam name="DecorationT">The type of the decoration</typeparam>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Context-based decoration is a pattern for easily augmenting existing data with additional information ("decorating" it).
    /// This is useful for any situation where you want more data to be associated with a specific instance than is provided by
    /// that instance by default. For example, <see cref="PokeInteractor"/>s do not expose a notion of "handedness" indicating
    /// whether the user is poking with the left or right hand; however, if knowing that information is important for your
    /// scenario, you can make it available by decorating the interactor with a handedness value.
    ///
    /// The simplest mechanism of decoration is to simply make a Dictionary in which you could associate an individual
    /// interactor with a handedness value. This solution is perfectly viable, but it leaves certain question unaddressed.
    /// Where is that Dictionary? How do you access it? Who is responsible for removing decorations when the information becomes
    /// outdated (such as when the interactor is destroyed)? And, if decorations are added at runtime, how can they be safely
    /// queried without risking order-of-operations dependencies?
    ///
    /// Another simple mechanism of decoration in Unity is appending MonoBehaviours as decorations. For example, you could make
    /// an `InteractorHandedness` MonoBehaviour with a queryable `Handedness` field, then attach an instance of that
    /// MonoBehaviour to the GameObject of each PokeInteractor you wished to decorate; then, to retrieve your decoration, you
    /// could call `GetComponent<InteractorHandedness>` on the PokeInteractor. This, too, is viable and addresses some of the
    /// unanswered questions of a pure Dictionary-based approach. However, it also introduces some limitations and
    /// inconveniences: decorations must be characterized as MonoBehaviours or other types fetchable using `GetComponent`,
    /// limiting the types of data that can be used as decorations; and they must be attached to specific GameObjects, which
    /// can complicate their integration with prefabs and can have other undesirable side effects such as cluttering the Editor
    /// interface.
    ///
    /// DecoratorBase and its descendant types (<see cref="ValueToClassDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>,
    /// <see cref="ClassToClassDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>, and <see cref="ClassToValueDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>)
    /// support Context-based decoration, an alternative pattern to the two described above which avoids some of the issues with
    /// each. Conceptually, these decorators are simply Dictionaries that live as singletons on the <see cref="Context"/>,
    /// resolving questions about the decorator's ownership and accessibility. These decorators also automatically manage the
    /// lifecycle of their entries (the exact mechanism of which varies by concrete type), resolving questions about removing
    /// outdated information. The decorators also all provide both synchronous and asynchronous query mechanisms to deal with the
    /// the fact that decorations can be added at any time, providing callers methods to either try to retrieve any decorations
    /// available immediately or asynchronously wait until a decoration becomes available. All these capabilities are provided
    /// without any constraint on either what can be decorated or what can be used as a decoration: decorations need not be Unity
    /// types, and they needn't show up in the Editor unless the developer of the decoration wants them to. In sum, Context-based
    /// decoration, supported by DecoratorBase and its descendant types, provides a convenient and flexible way to decorate
    /// arbitrary instances with arbitrary data without incurring some of the costs of other approaches.
    ///
    /// This is not the say that DecoratorBase and its descendant types should supersede all other forms of decoration. These
    /// tools are powerful and valuable for appropriate uses, but may not be valuable for others. Note the conspicuous absence of
    /// a `ValueToValueDecorator` type; this is omitted because value-to-value decoration provides no way for decorators to
    /// automatically manage the lifecycle of the decorative relationship (because values have no lifecycle), reducing the utility
    /// of a value-to-value decorator over a simple Dictionary to the point where a simple Context-local Dictionary singleton
    /// is more appropriate than a specialized decorator type. For further information on the lifecycle management features of
    /// the decorators, see the remarks on <see cref="ValueToClassDecorator{InstanceT, DecorationT}"/>,
