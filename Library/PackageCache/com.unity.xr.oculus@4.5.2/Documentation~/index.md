# Oculus XR Plugin

The Oculus XR Plugin enables you to build applications for a variety of Oculus devices including the Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, Quest Pro, Quest 3, and Quest 3S.

> [!NOTE]
> From [OpenXR 1.14](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.14), the [Unity OpenXR: Meta 2.1](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.meta-openxr@2.1) package is at feature parity with the Oculus plugin. Unity will focus feature development on OpenXR, and recommends that users of the Oculus XR plugin [Migrate to OpenXR](openxr-migration.md) for long-term support and cross-platform compatibility.

Refer to the following topics to use the Oculus plugin and understand how to migrate your project to OpenXR:
